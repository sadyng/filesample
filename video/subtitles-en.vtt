00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.650
Welcome to Getting Started
with Music Theory.

3
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.849
My name is Bruce Taggart.

4
00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.479
I teach music theory in the College of
Music at Michigan State University.

5
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.380
This class is for

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.730
anyone who is interested in starting
to learn the technical side of music.

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.230
Maybe you play guitar and wonder how
chords work and why some chords sound good

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.670
and some chords sound bad when
you're harmonizing a melody.

9
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.740
Maybe you'd like to arrange songs for

10
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.800
a vocal group you sing in or
a band you play in.

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.720
Maybe you're interested in composing,
this course is a good place to start.

12
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.470
Although, it helps to be able to read
music, and know something about scales and

13
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.980
chords, it's not required.

14
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.230
I'll start with basic melody,
basic harmony and basic musical notation.

15
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.440
By the end of the course we'll be reading
music in bass and treble clefs, notating

16
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.800
rhythms in duple and triple meters, and
talking about triads and seventh chords,

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.530
notating them and labeling them using
several different chord notation systems.

18
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.330
The course is mostly about
western tonal music, that is,

19
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.740
the musical language that started
around 600 years ago in Europe

20
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.640
growing into our classical popular and
jazz music of today.

21
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.920
We'll look at nuts and
bolts of tonal music.

22
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.560
What makes it tonal?

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.870
How do the individual notes combined
into melodies, chords and harmonies?

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.280
How do rhythm and
meter organize music in time?

25
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.581
How do we write it all down?

26
00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:46.360
And what special terminology and
labels we can use to explain it all?

27
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.440
That, after all,
is what music theory is really all about.

28
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.907
This all can sound very technical and
intimidating but

29
00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:59.590
I'm not going to be telling you anything
that your ears don't already know.

30
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.360
If you listen to music and make music,

31
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.380
even just singing in the shower, you
understand it already, at least by sound.

32
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.210
All music theory does is label and

33
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.020
explain what you already are an expert in,
as a listener.

34
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.040
This course is just the beginning.

35
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.325
From here you could go on to study more
advanced music theory, you can compose and

36
00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:28.471
notate your own melodies and you can add
harmonies to tunes you write and hear.

37
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.611
So let's get started.

00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:33.759
